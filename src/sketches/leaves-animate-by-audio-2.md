_extends leaves-animate-by-audio.md_

OK thanks. That's working. But it's drawing a representation of the audio frequencies. What I would like is for a simple stylalised tree to be drawn on the canvas. It's leaves should animate as though they are being moved by the audio, for which I will use a wind sound effect. The tree is an oak.
