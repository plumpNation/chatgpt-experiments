Write me javascript code where an audio track animates the creation of foliage in the browser canvas object.

That won't work, because browsers won't allow playing audio until users interact. Perhaps a mouseup event to build the audio element would be better.

_edited code myself to load my own mp3 file, and remove the audio player from the DOM_
